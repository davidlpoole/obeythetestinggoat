## Chapter 12: Tips on Organising Tests and Refactoring

Just as you use multiple files to hold your application code, you should split your tests out into multiple files.

- For functional tests, group them into tests for a particular feature or user story.
- For unit tests, use a folder called tests, with an `__init__.py`
- You probably want a separate test file for each tested source code file. For Django, thatâ€™s
  typically `test_models.py`, `test_views.py`, and `test_forms.py`.
- Have at least a placeholder test for every function and class.
